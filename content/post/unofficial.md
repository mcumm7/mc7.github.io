This blog describes how I designed, marketed, sold, and produced a limited apparel release for Unofficial.

## Early stages

My very first designs were rough to say the least. But that's all a part of the design process.

## Creating and marketing concepts

The final designs are a lot more polished than the above.

I marketed these designs exclusively through social media, namely Groupme and Instagram.

{{< figure src="/hoodie.png" caption="The most popular item sold. Came in two colors, black and white." >}}

{{< figure src="/crew.png" caption="The second most popular item sold. Came in white and two shades of green." >}}

{{< figure src="/tee.png" caption="Not the most popular, but sold many nevertheless." >}}

## Results

I surpassed my sales goal, for a total of approximately $8k in sales. This was through both an online store and Campus Ink's retail location called The Lab.
